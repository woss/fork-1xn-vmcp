UPLOAD_PROMPT_DESCRIPTION = """Create a custom prompt in the active MCP configuration. 

IMPORTANT: USE THIS TOOL ONLY WHEN SPECIALLY REQUESTED BY THE USER.


INPUT FORMAT:
The tool accepts a single JSON object containing all prompt configuration.

VARIABLES EXPLANATION:
Variables are placeholders in prompt text that can be filled with different values each time the prompt is used.
- Variables are referenced in prompt text using the format: @param.variableName
- Each variable has a name, description, and required flag
- When the prompt is used, users will be prompted to provide values for these variables
- Variables make prompts flexible and reusable for different contexts

JSON EXAMPLE WITHOUT VARIABLES (Simple Static Prompt):
{
  "name": "meeting_summarizer",
  "description": "Summarize meeting notes",
  "text": "Please summarize the following meeting notes in bullet points, highlighting key decisions and action items."
}

JSON EXAMPLE WITH VARIABLES (Dynamic Prompt):
{
  "name": "code_reviewer",

  "text": "Review this @param.language code focusing on @param.focus_area. Provide feedback on @param.code",

WHEN TO USE VARIABLES:
- Use variables when you need the same prompt structure with different inputs
- Use for prompts that will be reused with different data/contexts  
- Avoid variables for simple, static prompts that don't need customization

BEST PRACTICES:
- Keep variable names short and descriptive
- Use clear descriptions for each variable
- Mark variables as required only when absolutely necessary
- Use variables only when necessary. Do not unnecessarily use variables. Simple static prompts should not have variables.
- Test your prompt with sample variable values before creating it"""
